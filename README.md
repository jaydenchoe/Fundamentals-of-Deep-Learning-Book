# Fundamentals of Deep Learning (Forked & Updated)

This repository is a **fork** of the official code companion to [*Fundamentals of Deep Learning, Second Edition*](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Deep-Learning-Next-Generation-Intelligence/dp/1491925612), originally maintained by [Nithin Buduma](https://github.com/darksigma), [Nikhil Buduma](https://github.com/darksigma), [Joe Papa](https://github.com/joe-papa), and other contributors.  
All algorithms are implemented in [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/).

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s different in this fork?

- **PyTorch & Python updates**  
  Code patched to run on the latest stable Python (3.12) and PyTorch (2.3+) environments.  
- **Minimal fixes only**  
  Preserved the algorithms as-is; applied only compatibility fixes (e.g., deprecated APIs, dataset loading, tokenizer changes).  
- **Scope of changes**  
  Updates focus on **Chapter 9 onward**, where runtime issues were reported. Earlier chapters remain unchanged.  
- **Colab-ready**  
  Verified notebooks run smoothly on Google Colab without extra setup beyond installing PyTorch/Datasets.

## Guide to the repository

The structure follows the original:

- Each chapterâ€™s examples are in the corresponding folder (e.g., `Ch09_04_Dissecting_NTN.ipynb`).  
- Most examples are provided as **Google Colab notebooks**; some `.py` scripts are also included.  
- Code from the First Edition remains in `first_edition_archive/`.

## Running the notebooks

You can run the Google Colab notebooks directly from this fork.
